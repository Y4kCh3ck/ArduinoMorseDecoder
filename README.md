# ArduinoMorseDecoder

## Overview
Just a simple Uniersity Project based on Arduino that translates series of light signals into human-readable text. 

## Compiling
In order try it yourself just download files from src and run then using Arduino IDE. 

## Arduino schematics
Connect Arduino UNO as below or change code according to your liking. I used 5.1 kOm resistor. You can play with readState() function to figure out, which voltage level matches your configuration.
